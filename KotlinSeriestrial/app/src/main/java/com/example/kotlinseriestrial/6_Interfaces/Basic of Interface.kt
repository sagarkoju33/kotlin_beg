/*

  1. What is an Interface?
    An interface in Kotlin is a blueprint for a class that defines what a class should do, but not how.
    It is similar to an abstract class but:

    Cannot store state (i.e., no instance variables).
    Only provides method declarations (though it can have method implementations).
    A class can implement multiple interfaces (Unlike inheriting from only one class).
    Think of an interface like a contract â€“ if a class implements an interface,
    it must follow the rules set by the interface.
