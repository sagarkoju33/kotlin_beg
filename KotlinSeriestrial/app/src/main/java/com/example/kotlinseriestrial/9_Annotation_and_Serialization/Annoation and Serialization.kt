/*
    What are Annotations in Kotlin?
    Annotations in Kotlin are special metadata that provide extra information to the compiler or runtime.

    They do not change how the program runs but help in code analysis, reflection, and code generation.
    Common use cases:
    Marking deprecated functions
    Defining serialization rules
    Enabling reflection & dependency injection
*/

/*
 How to Define and Use Annotations?
 Built-in Annotations
 Kotlin provides several built-in annotations, such as:
 @Deprecated Marks a function/class as deprecated.
 @JvmStatic  Makes a function static in Java.
 @Throws Specifies exceptions that a function can throw.
 @Suppress  Suppresses compiler warnings.

/*
    Serialization in Kotlin :
    Serialization is the process of converting objects into a format (JSON, XML, etc.)
    that can be stored or transferred.
