/*

kotlin is created by jet brain in 2010-11 and first version released in 2016.
Kotlin compiles to JVM bytecode → Runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) like Java.
Kotlin code is converted to Java bytecode → Executed by the JVM.


Why JetBrains Created Kotlin?

    JetBrains needed a modern language that:
    Was interoperable with Java.
    Had better syntax (less boilerplate code).
    Was type-safe (avoiding NullPointerExceptions).
    Had first-class support for functional programming.

Since existing languages like Scala, Groovy, and Clojure had issues (slow compilation, complexity),
JetBrains decided to create their own language.


Why Did Google Choose Kotlin as the Official Language? (accepted official language in 2017)

Ans->   Java had limitations → Kotlin solved them with better syntax and safety.
        Kotlin was 100% interoperable with Java → No need to rewrite code.
        JetBrains actively supports Kotlin → Frequent updates & improvements.
        Kotlin had massive developer demand → Many Android developers preferred Kotlin over Java.
        Google wanted a modern, efficient language → Kotlin has better performance and fewer crashes.

How popular it is right Now and its Scope :->

    Kotlin is already used by over 60% of professional Android developers,
    and 95% of the top 1,000 Android apps contain Kotlin code.
